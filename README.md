Ant Sandbox

A Godot 3.2. project to learn steering behaviors with no frills.

I picked ants as a theme because they are fascinating and making working sprites for them was easier than e.g fish or birds, which were also valid options.
(Also I might have been influenced by the fact they could be put in a literal sandbox)

Implemented:

* arrive
* seek
* wander
